# data_structures

This is a work in progress repository in which I'm implementing various data structures. Wherever possible, I'm referencing the well-known [CLRS Textbook](https://github.com/CodeClub-JU/Introduction-to-Algorithms-CLRS/blob/master/Introduction%20to%20Algorithms%20-%203rd%20Edition.pdf), so the code and comments may make more sense when taken in context with this textbook. My goal is to make a suite of easy-to-use data structures that are well-commented, allowing a user to better understand the data structure simply by reading through the code, and that are well-tested to ensure correctness. Each data structure is in a file named `<data_structure>.py` and has an associated test suite named `test_<data_structure>.py` that uses Python's [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase) module.

The following data structures have been implemented:
* Red Black Trees
